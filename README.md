# Climbing Tracker
This is a Python-based project that climbers can use to track their climbing history and evaluate their development. It uses the json, tkinter and statistics libraries.

 ## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

```
climbing-tracker
├── data
│   └── climbing_data.json
├── src
│   └── climbing_tracker.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```
- `climbing_data.jason`: This file includes all the saved climbing routes, difficulty levels, number of attempts and completed(yes/no) provided via user input
- `climbing_tracker`: This file is the main script for the project. It interacts with the user via an interface in which the user can insert information on the climbing routes. It also evaluates the user input and provides statistics on the climbing development of the user.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python packages for the project, including json, tkinter, statistics

## Usage

To use the climbing tracker, run the `climbing_tracker.py` script. The script will ask the user for input and tracks the input accordingly.
